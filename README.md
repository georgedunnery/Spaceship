# Spaceship 
### An Alternate Take on the Classic Hangman
This is an implementation of Hangman in Python using Turtle that I wrote for an assignment during my first semester as a CS student. 

To play the game, open the spaceship_game.py file in IDLE and run the module. A turtle window will display the game state while the user guesses letters in the command line window.
